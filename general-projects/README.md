These projects include code written for and by a Udemy course creator.
I have not included their solution code, because I don't want to give away their whole course.

In some cases I wrote the code from the ground up, and in some cases, there was preexisting code, with specific requirements.
In most cases, my solutions are more robust than the course required.
I tried to think about the requests as real world requests, so sometimes my code is more robust than the course might have explicitly asked for.
